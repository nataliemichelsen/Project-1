# Project-1

We are currently going through a world epidemic. This is creating a lot of financial, social, and physical struggles throughout the world. One of the best thing you can do to fight the current situation is stay knowledgeable and educated about the current situation. For this reason, we decided to create a market analysis app. Our program takes user input for up to X publicly traded companies, and displays the current news and stock information for each company. This way it allows the user to stay informed and educated on the current situation and market.

Our group task was to breakdown assignments by individual and successfully collaborate to reach our mutual goals. 

We used HTML, CSS, and JS to write out our code. We used GitHub to store our repository. We used Materialize CSS for our outline (not recommended). 

All team members contributed in their best way:
Ahmed was a killer with the JS and was able to code out the majority of our JS outline as well as our overall design/layout. He was able to quickly debug the massive amount of errors we encountered through the use of one of our API's. 
Natalie handled Materialize and the CSS outline, and then greatly assisted with the JS and HTML after the outlines were established. She also hosted the project on GitHub, oversaw the production of the project, and wrote the presentation slides. 
Collin had the idea for the project and it was becuase of this that we were able to stay completely on-track for the entirety of the project. He blasted out of the gate by setting up our HTML outline and that enabled Ahmed and Natalie to do what they needed on JS and CSS.

Throughout the project some things needed to be adjusted slightly so other elements would work properly. All team members "jumped into action" and made these adjustments when and where ever necessary. After the outlines were done, each team member had the freedom to code where they wanted if they saw something that needed to be done. 

All team members kept the entire project on track throughout the entire process because we worked really well as a team, had a clear goal in mind, and utilized our individual skills to our group's advantage. 

Overall, it was a very efficient group and we all enjoyed working on the project together.
